## Getting started
To be added

## Running the program
From the directory where the .jar file is located, run the following command:
```
java âˆ’jar scheduler.jar INPUT.dot P [OPTION]
```
* INPUT.dot is a task graph to be processed 
* P is the number of processors to schedule the input graph on

### Optional:
* -p N  -- use N cores for execution in parallel (default is sequential)
* -v    -- visualize the search
* -o OUTPUT -- OUTPUT is the name of the output .dot file
